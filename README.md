# Open Mainframe Project COBOL Working Group

It is generally felt by those close to the technology and supporting environment that COBOL has a part to play in a digital future, building upon the success of the past and its vitality in the present. This is true in the mainframe world, where COBOL prevails, and in distributed environments where it has a greater usage than most realize. 

Establishing a working group of COBOL thought leaders and exponents that aims to address misunderstanding about the technology and promote its continued usage, learning and discourse.

**Goals of the COBOL Working Group are:**

1. Greatly increase COBOL’s exposure to the public, specifically the IT decision-makers who will directly affect how widely COBOL will be employed in the future; 
2. Clearly describe why COBOL should return to the general college curriculum;
3. Gather data and promote COBOL’s importance to the global economy;
4. Provide avenues by which those seeking COBOL skills can acquire them;
5. Establish a group of thought leaders and key persons in this space to act as global proponents and commentators on the language and its enduring value.

**Non-goals of the COBOL Working Group are:**

1. Develop a vendor or platform specific perspective of COBOL.
2. Develop a preference for one platform over another.
